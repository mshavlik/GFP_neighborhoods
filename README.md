# GFP_neighborhoods
Raw data and analysis code used to produce the results in the main text data figures of "Local Structural Stability Alters the Evolutionary Neighborhoods of GFP-Like Proteins"

## Figures 1 and 2
These figures are mostly 'conjectogram' heavy and illustrate the conceptual framework of the project.

## Figure 3
This folder contains the flow cytometry files for channel standardization and autofluorescence correction, the raw flow cytometry data from ancGFP libraries, as well as the analysis code used to analyze those data and the resulting graphs. 

## Figure 4
Similar to figure 3, this folder contains the same flow cytometry calibration data and results for anc15, as well as the analysis code. 

## Figure 5
The data obtained for ancGFP Q62H, ancGFP T69A, anc15 H62Q, and anc15 A69T are stored here. Additionally, there are Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of these data. *Figure_5_code* was used to analyze all genotypes except ancGFP T69A. The other Jupyter notebook *T69A_specific_code* was used for ancGFP T69A. The reason here is because T69A data was gathered at a later point in time, where a package used prior for reading and writing .fcs files had now deprecated. Thus, an alternative method needed to be used to prepare and read in the .fcs files for T69A. 

## Figure 6
This folder contains the photoconversion time series data for anc15 and anc15 A69T. For each of these, the raw data is included, as well as the code used to generate the neighborhoods over time and the line graph as seen in figure 6B of the paper. 

## Figure 7
Here, the raw spreadsheet data for Gdm HCl denaturation of the fluorescent proteins can be found. Additionally, the analysis code used to fit a 2-state folding model to the data and extract a cM parameter for stability is included.
